# PS-05 Technical Implementation Guide

## Recommended Technology Stack

### Deep Learning Frameworks
- **Primary**: PyTorch with torchvision
- **Alternative**: TensorFlow/Keras

### Computer Vision Libraries
- OpenCV for image preprocessing
- Albumentations for data augmentation
- Pillow for basic image handling

### Document AI Models
- LayoutLM/LayoutLMv3 (Microsoft)
- PaddleOCR (Baidu)
- Detectron2 (Facebook) for object detection

### Experiment Tracking
- Weights & Biases or MLflow
- TensorBoard for visualization

### Development Tools
- Git for version control
- Docker for containerization
- pytest for testing
- black/flake8 for code formatting

## Model Architecture Options

### Option 1: Pre-trained Object Detection
Faster R-CNN or Mask R-CNN with ResNet backbone pre-trained on COCO, fine-tuned on document layout datasets.

### Option 2: Transformer-based
LayoutLM/LayoutLMv3 with visual backbone for document understanding, fine-tuned for bounding box detection.

### Option 3: Two-stage Approach
First stage: Document segmentation using U-Net or DeepLabV3+
Second stage: Classification and bounding box refinement

## Dataset Strategy

### Training Data
- Split into train/validation sets (80/20)
- Ensure representation of all document types and languages
- Apply data augmentation (rotation, scaling, brightness changes)

### Validation Strategy
- Use stratified sampling to ensure all document categories are represented
- Evaluate using the same MaP metric as the competition
- Track performance across different document types and languages

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Data Processing Pipeline**:
   - Load and parse JSON annotations
   - Preprocess images (resize, normalize, augment)
   - Create dataset classes and data loaders

2. **Model Training Loop**:
   - Define loss functions (classification and bounding box regression)
   - Implement training and validation loops
   - Save checkpoints and track experiments

3. **Evaluation System**:
   - Implement MaP calculation at IoU >= 0.5
   - Visualize predictions vs ground truth
   - Generate error analysis reports

4. **Output Generation**:
   - Convert model predictions to required JSON format
   - Validate output against competition requirements
   - Automate submission process
