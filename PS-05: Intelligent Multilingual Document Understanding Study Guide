PS-05: Intelligent Multilingual Document Understanding Study Guide
I. General Overview
This document outlines the "PS-05: Intelligent Multilingual Document Understanding" AI Grand Challenge. The core problem addresses the complexities of extracting structured and semantically correct information from diverse, visually rich, and multilingual digital documents. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems are insufficient for this task due to issues like jumbled text, mixed scripts, and the inability to correctly interpret document elements such as tables, images, maps, and charts. The challenge aims to develop AI systems capable of generating structured, machine-friendly, yet human-readable outputs that preserve visual hierarchy, semantic grouping, and layout fidelity, thereby enhancing downstream AI/ML tasks.
II. Key Objectives and Challenges
The primary objective is to achieve multilingual, layout-aware document parsing across various scripts, formats, and writing directions. Specific languages targeted include English, Hindi, Urdu, Arabic, Nepalese, and Persian. The solution must accurately extract structured information, maintaining:
• Visual hierarchy (headings, sections)
• Semantic grouping (form fields, captions, references)
• Layout fidelity (table structures, image alignment, reading order)
• Interpretation of embedded elements (charts, plots, maps, figures)
The extracted content needs to be represented in a standardized JSON format, with natural language descriptions for non-textual elements (tables, images, maps, charts) and line-wise bounding box coordinates for text.
III. Challenge Stages and Evaluation
The challenge is divided into three stages, with evaluation metrics evolving across stages:
Stage 1 (Document Layout Focus):
• Evaluation Parameter: Document Layout (Mean Average Precision - MaP at bbox threshold >= 0.5).
• Datasets: Training Dataset (up to 10 GB), Mock Dataset (up to 10 GB for self-assessment and leaderboard), Shortlisting Dataset (up to 10 GB for selecting top 15-20 participants), Holdout Test Set (up to 10 GB for final evaluation).
• Input/Output: Input will be JPEG/PNG images (potentially rotated, blurred, noisy). Output must be a JSON for each image detailing bounding box coordinates [x,y,h,w] and the class of the detected segment (e.g., Text, Table, Figure).
• Offline Evaluation: Shortlisted participants will demonstrate their solutions on provided resources (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, 48+ core CPU, 256+ GB RAM, A-100 GPU). Evaluation will consider mAP score (50% weight), robustness/efficiency (execution time, 10%), resource utilization (memory footprint, 10%), approach/methodologies (20%), and team capabilities (10%).
Stage 2 & 3 (Expanded Metrics):
• Evaluation Parameters: Document Layout (MaP), Text Extraction (Character Error Rate - CER / Word Error Rate - WER), Chart/Map to Natural Language Text (BlueRT + BertScore RT), Table to Natural Language Text (T2T-Gen), Language Identification accuracy, precision, recall.
• Mentorship: Sessions with Mentors/Experts will be provided for selected participants.
• Languages: Additional languages will be introduced in Stage 2 and 3.
IV. Dataset Information
The challenge utilizes indicative datasets for training and testing, including DocLayNet, PubLayNet, RvlCdip, ICDAR-MLT 2019, HI-OCR, FUNSD, and SROIE. Organization-specific data will be used in Stage 3.
V. Output Format Details
The envisaged output for each document element is a JSON structure:
• Table: Natural language explanation of contents in plain text paragraphs with bbox coordinates.
• Image: Natural language description of contents with bbox coordinates.
• Map: Natural language description of contents with bbox coordinates.
• Chart: Natural language description of contents with bbox coordinates.
• Text: Extracted text with line-wise bbox coordinates and identified language.

Answer Key (Quiz)
1. Traditional OCRs often fail to extract semantically correct text from various document elements like tables, images, or charts, leading to jumbled or mixed text. They also struggle with mixed scripts, making the output unsuitable for downstream AI/ML tasks.
2. The AI systems are expected to handle a wide range of documents including legal contracts, academic papers, business reports, government forms, presentation decks, social media posts, and personal screenshots. These can be in formats like Word documents, PDFs, PowerPoint slides, and scanned images.
3. Besides English, the documents will contain Hindi, Urdu, Arabic, Nepalese, and Persian. (Any two of these are acceptable).
4. Layout fidelity refers to preserving the original structural arrangement of the document's elements. This includes maintaining table structures, image alignment, and the correct reading order of content, ensuring the visual integrity of the document is captured.
5. The content of an image should be represented in the final JSON output as a natural language description of its contents. This description should also be accompanied by the bounding box (bbox) coordinates of the image.
6. The main evaluation metric for "Document Layout" in Stage 1 is Mean Average Precision (MaP). This metric is specifically applied at a bounding box threshold of greater than or equal to 0.5.
7. Participants will receive input in the form of JPEG/PNG images of documents. These images may also be rotated, blurred, or noisy, requiring the solution to handle such variations.
8. The Mock Dataset in Stage 1 is provided for participants to test their solutions and for self-assessment. While participants submit results on this set, they do not have access to the ground truth, and it is used to publish a leaderboard, but not for official evaluation or selection.
9. During the offline solution evaluation in Stage 1, participants are expected to run their solutions on an Ubuntu 24.04 LTS operating system. The GPU provided will be an A-100 with either 40 or 80 GB of memory.
10. In Stage 2, new evaluation metrics include Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) for text extraction, BlueRT + BertScore RT for chart/map to natural language text, T2T-Gen for table to natural language text, and language identification accuracy, precision, and recall.
