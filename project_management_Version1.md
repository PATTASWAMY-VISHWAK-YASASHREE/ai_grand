## Collaboration Tools

### Version Control
- GitHub repository with branching strategy:
  - `main`: Stable, working code
  - `develop`: Integration branch
  - Feature branches for each task

### Documentation
- README.md with project overview
- Wiki pages for technical documentation
- Progress tracking in project board

### Communication
- Daily asynchronous updates
- Weekly synchronous meetings
- Code reviews for all pull requests

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Model Performance**: Monitor metrics regularly, have fallback approaches
2. **Data Quality**: Implement robust preprocessing and validation
3. **Compute Resources**: Optimize code for efficiency, have backup computation plan

### Team Risks
1. **Knowledge Gaps**: Regular knowledge sharing sessions, pair programming
2. **Timeline Slippage**: Weekly reviews, adjust scope if necessary
3. **Integration Issues**: Regular integration tests, clear interfaces between components
